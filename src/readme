
Progress Bar Exercise:

Create a progress bar that takes in a 
seconds input and starts filling upon clicking a 
“Start” button. The progress bar should take the number of
 supplied seconds to fill and should do so at a constant rate. 
 Once filled, the progress bar should be able to handle restarting 
 the fill process if a user clicks “Start” again (with possibly a 
 different fill time).

Feel free to use any outside libraries you need - 
do not hesitate to look up documentation or to ask your 
interviewers questions about the exercise. 
Be sure to explain your thought process as you 
go through the exercise - showing your interviewers how you think 
is as important as getting the right answer. 
Refer to the provided screenshot for a general idea of what the
 progress bar should look like.
